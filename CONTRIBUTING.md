# Contributing

## Content

### Talks
* Recognised types: `slides`, `video`, `article`
* `date` should be in ISO 8601 format
* Make sure there is a corresponding author entity (we intersect by `name`)

### Author
* `emailAddress` is used for the Gravatar

## Git process
The `master` branch only contains sources. `gh-pages` only contains the compiled
code.

* Create a branch off of ``master``
* Commit only your changes to ``src``
* Open a Pull Request
